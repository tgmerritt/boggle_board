# Boggle Board (in Ruby)

I found some code online at http://learnruby.com/boggle/ on the classic Boggle Board puzzle, and I wanted to preserve a copy of the code that I could mess with whenever I had some free time.  I've preserved all the attributions in the header of each file to give credit to J. Eric Ivancich.  

As his original solution was written in 2007, there are very likely improvements that can be made, and that's the primary purpose of this repo.
